## What do we know about Java?

* Mores specific with data types
* Won't run with errors, it will stop at compiling
    * Even if the error is in a different file.
* Classes are important. Everything is inside of a class.
* All classes need a main method. Everything starts from the main method.
* It is very specific.
* Strings are objects.
    
## What are we not sure about Java?

* Concept of passing arguments to a method and return them.
* Recursion and how it stacks the calls.
* All the specific number of types.
* What is a static...
* What it can do... more capabilities.
* Private vs Public


# Java Types:

* What is static? <- a modifier changes the way we use functions / methods.
    * It allows us to use a method without to create an object
        * It allows us to use methods as if it were a function in JS.

* public vs private?
    * It is another modifier
    * From which places we can call a method
    * Private: These methods can only be called from this class
    * Public means it can be called from all classes.
